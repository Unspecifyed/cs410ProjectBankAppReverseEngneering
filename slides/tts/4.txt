To address these issues, I propose several enhancements. First, we should implement comprehensive error handling to make the application robust. Enhancing security measures, such as adding password salting and using a more secure hashing algorithm, is essential. Completing the transaction functions will provide the necessary functionality. Adding input validation will protect against injection attacks. Improving documentation and implementing testing will ensure the code is maintainable and functions as expected. These enhancements demonstrate skills in secure coding, error handling, and software engineering principles, aligning with our course outcomes.
