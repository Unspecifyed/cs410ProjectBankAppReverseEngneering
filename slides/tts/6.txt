Analyzing the code reveals several weaknesses. Using uint8_t for cents can lead to overflow issues since it only supports values up to 255. Separating dollars and cents may introduce calculation errors, and handling money as floating-point numbers is risky due to precision errors. The password hashing algorithm is not secure enough without salting. Additionally, the balance handling logic for carry-over in cents to dollars is inefficient and could be improved.
