To enhance the code, we should use appropriate data types, such as representing monetary values using a single integer or a high-precision decimal type to avoid overflow and precision issues. Improving password security by switching to algorithms like bcrypt or Argon2 with salting will protect against attacks. Optimizing the balance calculation logic will improve efficiency. Implementing data validation ensures arithmetic operations are safe. These changes demonstrate skills in selecting appropriate data structures and implementing secure algorithms, aligning with our course outcomes.
